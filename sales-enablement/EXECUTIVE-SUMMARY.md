## Leadership Development That Actually Works

---

### The Problem

**70% of leadership training fails to create lasting behavior change.**

Traditional workshops create a "knowledge bump" that fades within weeks. Leaders return to old habits, organizations see no ROI, and the cycle repeats.

**Your managers need daily practice, not occasional events.**
