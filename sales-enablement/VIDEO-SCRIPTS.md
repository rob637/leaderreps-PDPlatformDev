## 1. Two-Minute Explainer Video

**Target:** 2:00  
**Use:** Website hero, email campaigns, sales follow-up, trade shows

### Script

**[0:00-0:15] THE HOOK**

*Visual: Leader looking frustrated after a workshop, checking phone a week later*

> "You've done the leadership workshop. You got the binder. 
> Two weeks later... nothing's changed.
> 
> You're not alone. 70% of leadership training fails to create lasting change."

**[0:15-0:35] THE PROBLEM**

*Visual: Calendar showing sporadic training events, then daily grind*

> "Here's why: Leadership isn't learned in a two-day event.
> It's built through daily practice. Small reps. Consistent habits.
> 
> But who has time for that? Your managers are buried in meetings, 
> putting out fires, trying to hit targets."

**[0:35-1:05] THE SOLUTION**

*Visual: App interface - dashboard, morning practice, streak counter*

> "LeaderReps changes that.
> 
> We combine an 8-week Foundation program with daily practice in The Arena.
> 
> Four live sessions with expert trainers — where leaders learn frameworks like 
> CLEAR Feedback and build their Leadership Identity.
> 
> Plus 10 minutes a day in the app — morning intention, evening reflection — 
> building habits that stick.
> 
> And a cohort of 12 leaders growing together. Because leadership isn't a solo journey."

**[1:05-1:25] THE PROOF**

*Visual: Stats, testimonials, streak counters, progress screens*

> "The results? 
> 
> 78% completion rate — versus the industry average of 20%.
> Leaders averaging 16-day streaks.
> 3x increase in feedback given to their teams.
> 
> Real behavior change. Not just knowledge."

**[1:25-1:50] THE DIFFERENTIATOR**

*Visual: Three pillars - Community, Content, Coaching*

> "Three pillars make it work:
> 
> Community — a cohort that holds you accountable.
> Content — 95 videos, tools, and templates at your fingertips.
> Coaching — expert trainers who know your specific challenges.
> 
> It's not another app. It's not another workshop. 
> It's a complete ecosystem for leadership growth."

**[1:50-2:00] THE CTA**

*Visual: Contact info, website, demo button*

> "Ready to develop leaders who actually change?
> 
> Visit leaderreps.com or reach out to schedule a demo.
> 
> LeaderReps. Leadership development that happens every single day."

**Tone:** Direct, slightly provocative

### Script

*Visual: Quick cuts, text overlays, energetic pacing*

> "Your company spent $10,000 on leadership training last year.
> 
> [TEXT: 💸💸💸]
> 
> Want to know what you got for it?
> 
> A binder. Some Post-it notes. And managers who went right back to their old habits.
> 
> [TEXT: 70% of training fails]
> 
> Here's the secret no one tells you:
> 
> Leadership isn't taught in workshops.
> It's built in daily reps.
> 
> [TEXT: Daily reps > Annual events]
> 
> That's why we built LeaderReps.
> 
> Link in bio to see how it works."

## 3. The Problem (45 seconds) — LinkedIn / YouTube

**Target:** 0:45  
**Purpose:** Establish pain, position as thought leader  
**Tone:** Empathetic, authoritative

### Script

*Visual: Professional setting, talking head with B-roll*

> "I spent 15 years training leaders.
> 
> And I'll be honest — most of what we did didn't work.
> 
> We'd run a great two-day workshop. Leaders would leave inspired.
> 
> Then they'd go back to 47 emails, three fires to put out, and a team waiting for answers.
> 
> Within two weeks, everything we taught was gone.
> 
> The problem wasn't the content. It was the format.
> 
> Leadership development can't be an event. It has to be a practice.
> 
> Daily. Consistent. Supported.
> 
> That's what we built with LeaderReps. And it's changing how organizations develop their leaders.
> 
> Drop a comment if you've seen this pattern too."

> 
> 'My 1:1s went from status updates to actual coaching conversations.'
> 
> 'I finally feel like I know what kind of leader I want to be.'
> 
> This isn't about completing a program.
