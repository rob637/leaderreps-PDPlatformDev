## 2. Your Daily Practice

### The Power of Reps

Leadership is like fitness - it requires consistent practice. We call these small daily actions **"Reps"**. Each rep builds your leadership muscle over time.

### Morning Routine (AM Bookend)

Start your day with intention:

#### 1. Grounding Rep
- Read your **Leadership Identity Statement**
- Reflect on who you want to be as a leader
- Tap "I'm Grounded" when complete

#### 2. Win the Day
- Set **3 high-impact priorities** for today
- Focus on what will move the needle most
- These become your daily wins to track

#### 3. Daily Reps
- Review your assigned leadership habits
- Commit to practicing them today
- Check them off as you complete them

### Evening Routine (PM Bookend)

End your day with reflection:

#### 1. Review Your Wins
- Mark each win as ✅ Complete or ⏭️ Carry Over
- Incomplete wins automatically carry to tomorrow

#### 2. Daily Reflection
Answer three questions:
- **What went well?** - Celebrate your successes
- **What could be better?** - Learn from challenges
- **What will you focus on?** - Set tomorrow's intention

#### 3. Check Your Scorecard
- See your daily completion percentage
- Grounding + Wins + Reps = Your daily score

### Understanding Your Streak 🔥

Your streak counts consecutive days of activity:

| What You Did | Streak Result |
|--------------|---------------|
| Completed grounding, win, or rep | +1 day |
| Weekend with no activity | Maintained (grace period) |
| Weekday with no activity | Reset to 0 |

**Tip:** Even completing just your Grounding Rep keeps your streak alive!

### Leadership Identity Statement (LIS) Maker

Craft your personal Leadership Identity Statement:
1. Access the LIS Maker card on the dashboard.
2. Follow the prompt: "I am a [Core Value] leader who [Action] to create [Impact]."
3. Use the text area to draft and refine your statement.
4. Your statement will be saved and used in your daily grounding rep.
