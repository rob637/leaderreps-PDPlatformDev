            <h3>DO WE USE COOKIES AND PIXELS?</h3>
            <p>
              Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and server logs to 
              collect information about how our site is used. Information gathered through cookies and server logs may include the 
              date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our site, and the websites visited just before and just after 
              our own, as well as your IP address.
            </p>
            <p>
              A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, 
              that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically 
              designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, 
              but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, 
              not the cookies sent to you by other sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Company reserves the right to use technological equivalents of cookies, including social media pixels. These pixels 
              allow social media sites to track visitors to outside websites so as to tailor advertising messages users see while 
              visiting that social media website. The Company reserves the right to use these pixels in compliance with the policies 
              of the various social media sites.

            <p>
              By using our Website, you consent to our use of cookies. You can adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies or alert 
              you when cookies are being sent. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you may be asked to consent to 
              cookies when you first visit our Website.

            <h3>HOW DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p>

              automatically or through your voluntary action.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may disclose your personal information to a third party, including a lawyer or collection agency, when necessary to 
              enforce our terms of service or any other agreement between you and the Company.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may provide your information to any successor in interest in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, 
              reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of the Company's assets and/or business.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so by a court or other governmental authority.
            </p>

            <h3>HOW DO WE STORE AND PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p>
              We store your personal information on a cloud-based storage platform provided by a third party vendor. We employ 
              commercially reasonable methods to ensure the security of the information you provide to us and the information we 
              collect automatically. This includes using standard security protocols and working only with reputable third-party vendors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication. For this reason, we request that you do not send private 
              information to us by email. However, doing so is allowed, but at your own risk.
            </p>

            <h3>HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</h3>
            <p>
              It is our policy to post on this page any changes we make to our Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to how we 
              treat our users' personal information, we will notify you by a notice on the Website's home page. The date the privacy 
              policy was last revised is specified in the introduction to the Policy above. You are responsible for ensuring we have 
              an up-to-date active and deliverable email address for you, and for periodically visiting our Website and this privacy 
              policy to check for any changes.

            <h3>HOW MAY I REVIEW MY PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ASK THE COMPANY TO CHANGE OR DELETE IT?</h3>
            <p>
              You may request to access, correct, or delete your personal information at any time by contacting us at{' '}

            </p>

            <h3>HOW WE HANDLE "DO NOT TRACK" REQUESTS</h3>
            <p>
              The Company does not track its customers over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising. 
              Therefore, the Company does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals.
