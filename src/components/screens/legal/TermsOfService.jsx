              You hereby agree that any disputes arising from, or in any way related to, your use of the Website and any 
              products or services offered on or through the Website shall be resolved through binding arbitration in 
              Columbus, Ohio conducted by a single arbitrator under the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration 
              Association or any successor thereto. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award either party its 
              attorneys' fees or expenses in connection with such dispute; provided, however, that the arbitrator's fees 
              and expenses shall be divided equally between you and the Company.
            </p>
            <p>
              You hereby waive any right to class arbitration and agree that any arbitration involving you and the Company

            </p>
            <p>
              This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of these Terms of Use and your relationship with the Company.
            </p>

            <h3>Section 7. Indemnification</h3>
            <p>
              To the fullest extent provided by law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Company, its 
              officers, directors, employees, agents and third parties, for any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses 
              (including reasonable attorneys' fees) relating to or arising from (i) your violation of any of these Terms 
              of Use; (ii) your violation of any rights of a third party, or (iii) your violation of any applicable laws,

            <p>
              You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and the

            <h3>Section 9. Entire Agreement, Severability, and Governing Law</h3>
            <p>
              Unless otherwise specified herein, these Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and the 
              Company with respect to the Website and the products and services offered on and through the Website. These 
              Terms of Use supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral 
              or written, between you and the Company.
            </p>
            <p>
              If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law 
              including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the 
              invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most 
              closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              These Terms of Use shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to that 
              State's conflict of laws rules.
            </p>
