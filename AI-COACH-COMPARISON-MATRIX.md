| **Session Structure** | Challenge-based content variety | Guided conversation flow | Open-ended reflection | Structured check-ins |
| **If Leader Goes Dark** | Challenge resets weekly | Streak breaks, resets | No penalty, system waits | Prompts continue, gentle nudges |
| **"Carrot" Strategy** | Weekly challenges, community accountability | Streaks, completion satisfaction | Intrinsic value of insights | Weekly digest, accumulated wins |
| **Notification Philosophy** | Daily micro-actions, community sessions | Regular touchpoints | Speaks only when valuable | Scheduled + event-triggered |

## How Learning is Triggered

| Dimension | Ascent (Current) | Reppy (Current) | Crissy (Vision) | Jeffy (Vision) |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Primary Trigger** | Weekly challenge theme | Calendar (daily session time) | Real-world friction moments | Events (1:1s, meetings, decisions) |
| **Curriculum Model** | Rolling themes (8-week cycles) | Sequential focus areas | Diagnostic, pattern-triggered | Leader-chosen attributes (2-3) |
| **Content Timing** | Daily micro-content + deep dives | Scheduled in sessions | Surfaced when relevant | On-demand + in weekly digest |
| **Teaching Style** | Varied: videos, articles, tools, reflections | Conversational coaching | Single concept, high relevance | Tips, prep, follow-up |
| **Example Interaction** | "This week's challenge: Have 3 coaching conversations" | "Good morning! Let's reflect on delegation today." | "You've described conflict avoidance 4 times. Here's a lens." | "Your 1:1 with Sarah is tomorrow. Here's what to prepare." |

## Decision Points

### 1. One Platform or Multiple Apps?
**Question:** Should we consolidate or maintain separate experiences?

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **Ascent only** | Enhance existing Arena dashboard | Single platform, simpler | Limited AI conversation |
| **Ascent + Reppy** | Keep both as-is | Flexibility, different modes | Fragmentation, two apps to maintain |
| **Merge into Ascent** | Add Reppy's AI to Arena | Unified experience | More complex platform |
| **New unified app** | Build Crissy or Jeffy fresh | Clean slate, coherent vision | Abandons existing work |

### 2. Engagement Philosophy
**Question:** Do leaders need prompts/carrots to engage, or does that undermine development?

| If you believe... | Then lean toward... |
|-------------------|---------------------|

### 4. Utility vs. Development
**Question:** Is the primary value practical help or capability growth?

| If you believe... | Then lean toward... |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Help me prepare for my 1:1 | Jeffy |
| Help me see how I'm growing | Crissy |
| Help me build daily habits | Reppy |
| Help me consume great content | Ascent |

### 5. Tracking & Visibility
**Question:** Should progress be visually tracked or felt through evidence?

| If you believe... | Then lean toward... |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Show me charts, challenges completed | Ascent or Jeffy |
| Reflect my patterns back to me | Crissy |
| Show me session completion and streaks | Reppy |

### 6. Content Strategy
**Question:** How does the Read & Reps library and other content fit?

| If you believe... | Then lean toward... |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Weekly themed content delivery | Ascent |
| Conversational curriculum | Reppy |
| Situational, friction-triggered | Crissy |

## Open Questions for the Team

### For Everyone:
1. **Is this one unified system or multiple apps?** (Ascent in Arena vs. Reppy standalone vs. something new)
2. **What's the V1 user?** Foundation graduates? New to platform? Both?
3. **What's the minimum viable version that tests the core hypothesis?**
4. **Do we keep Reppy as a separate app or merge its AI into Ascent?**

### For Cristina:
1. **Is some structure acceptable during/right after Foundation?** Or does that poison the well?
2. **How do we bootstrap pattern detection?** How many interactions before insights?
3. **What's the "aha moment"** that makes the Arena feel different?
4. **How does Ascent's weekly challenge model fit** (or not fit) your vision?

### For Jeff:
1. **Which 3-5 features are must-haves** vs. nice-to-haves?
2. **How do we avoid notification fatigue** with weekly cadence?
3. **Are calendar/1:1 doc integrations realistic** given privacy concerns?
4. **Could weekly digest work within Ascent's existing challenge model?**

### For Rob:
1. **What does Foundation training need from the AI companion?**
2. **Is Reppy working well enough to keep** as a separate app, or should we merge?
3. **Resource constraints:** Can we build/maintain multiple approaches?
4. **Which approach best supports the business model** (subscription retention)?

## Recommendation: Start with What Exists, Add What's Valuable

### Phase 1: Enhance Ascent (4-6 weeks)
- Add **weekly digest/wins summary** (Jeff's idea) to existing challenge model
- Add **decision reflection prompt** (shared: Crissy + Jeff) to Friday reflections
- Test with current cohorts

### Phase 2: Integrate AI Conversations (6-8 weeks)
- Bring **Reppy's conversation capability** into Ascent as optional mode
- Add **event-driven prompts** (post-1:1, post-meeting) alongside challenges
- Begin **pattern tagging** on reflections

### Phase 3: Pattern Intelligence (8-12 weeks)
- Build **pattern detection** across accumulated data
- Add **"progress reflection"** (Crissy's insight surfacing)
- Personalize **challenge recommendations** based on patterns

### Phase 4: Adaptive Modes (12-16 weeks)
- Implement **graduation detection** (reduce prompts as leaders mature)
- Add **Crissy-style "oracle mode"** for advanced users
- Full **coach dashboard** with pattern summaries

This approach:
- **Preserves existing investment** (Ascent, Reppy)
- **Tests ideas incrementally** before full commitment
- **Doesn't require choosing** between philosophies upfront
- **Learns from real usage** what leaders actually want
