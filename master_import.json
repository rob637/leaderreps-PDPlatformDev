Never wait for an annual review.\n\n* **Primary Takeaway:** Sponsorship requires evidence (quantifiable impact), not just relationship. Lead with data showing competence and impact."

Leadership requires authenticity.\n\n* **Actionable Steps:**\n    * Define your \"vulnerability zone\" (what you share and what you keep private).\n    * Share one personal, high-leverage challenge you are currently facing (e.g., work/life balance).\n    * Actively advocate for an employee who has less power than you. This models safety for others."
